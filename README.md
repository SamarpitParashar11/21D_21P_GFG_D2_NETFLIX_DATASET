🎬 Cracking the Code: An Inside Look at Netflix’s Content Strategy
📌 Project Overview

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Netflix’s content library to uncover insights into its content strategy, trends, and patterns.
By analyzing movies and TV shows data, we aim to understand how Netflix curates content based on release year, genres, duration, country, and descriptions.

This project is part of my Data Analysis / Machine Learning learning journey, focusing on storytelling through data.

🎯 Objectives

Understand Netflix’s content distribution between Movies and TV Shows

Analyze content growth trends over the years

Explore popular genres and categories

Identify patterns in content descriptions (word repetition & phrases)

Study release year vs. content added trends
